# Scrape-Naver-Weather

Scrapes pieces of information regarding today's weather from Naver Weather (https://weather.naver.com/), and displays them nicely into a new org-buffer.

## TODO

This work is now under construction.

- Scrape information on fine dust/ultra fine dust/sunset hour
- Display in Org table
    - Since the HTML contains non-ASCII chars, consider them when drawing the table
